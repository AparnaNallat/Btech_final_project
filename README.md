Smart Energy Meter:
The project consists of a IOT Based Smart Energy Meter which helps the user to determine or monitor the energy consumption by an application. The application can be accessed by the user as well as the administrator who can control the energy consumption by disconnecting the power supply as soon as the user exceeds the pre-specified limit. 
This also helps to detect sudden voltage fluctuations.The Admin controls the system by a pair of switches that is directly biased with a relay that
mediates the control of the system. As the relay activates the load is disconnected from the system.
